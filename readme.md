Welcome! This repository showcases my learning journey through the Odin Project. Below, you'll find a summary of what I've accomplished and learned.

## Introduction
This project is part of my learning journey with the Odin Project. It includes knowledge that I have implemented to practice and improve my web development skills.

## Project Overview

Throughout this project, I have learned:
- Problem solving & understanding errors
- Functions
- Conditional statements
- Event handling to capture user interactions & DOM manipulation to update the UI based on user actions
